### What is Recall? <a href="#what-is-recall" id="what-is-recall"></a>

**Recall** is an extension of Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio Code to help you remember stuff using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced\_repetition).

It creates flashcards directly from your Markdown notes and letâ€™s you test yourself repeatedly to maximize your memory retention. This can be usefull when learning a new language, taking a course on a particular subject, remembering jokes or pretty much anything else you want to remember. The choice is yours ðŸ˜‰

### Why use it? <a href="#why-use-it" id="why-use-it"></a>

Spaced repetition using flashcards is one of the most effective methods to memorize things. However, creating them usually takes too much time and extra effort. **Recall** makes it super-easy by auto-detecting flashcards directly in your Markdown notes.
